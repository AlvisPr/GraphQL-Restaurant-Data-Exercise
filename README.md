The server will be running at `http://localhost:4000/graphql`.

## Usage
You can use tools like [GraphiQL](https://github.com/graphql/graphiql) or [Postman](https://www.postman.com/) to interact with your GraphQL server. You can modify and add data as you want as long as the server is running. It doesnâ€™t rewrite the data object in the code.

### Example Queries
- **Get all restaurants:**
    ```graphql
    {
      restaurants {
        id
        name
        cuisine
        location
      }
    }
    ```

- **Add a new restaurant:**
    ```graphql
    mutation {
      addRestaurant(name: "New Restaurant", cuisine: "Italian", location: "New York") {
        id
        name
      }
    }
    ```
